<p>Update on our hosting situation. I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce the final hosting location for our site here and for future projects will be <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku.com</a>. I had used them once before in the past before I had a set of domain names and now having that along with an updated set of features from Heroku&rsquo;s dev team, I&rsquo;m very happy to be hosting my stuff here.</p>

<p>Before the move, I had been trying to host on Bluehost. They provide an excellent spread of services and options for a great cost, however, they aren&rsquo;t very Rails specific, so trying to get setup there made for a fairly volatile combination of config files and weird apache hacks. So switching to Heroku should keep the site clean and stable.</p>

<p>Because of Heroku&rsquo;s very progressive support of Rails, I&rsquo;m actually hoping to get some experimental stuff up here to demo Rails 3. This site may even move to R3 before much longer. Just glad to finally have this site, namely the blog, up and running. Stay tuned for current projects and other updates!</p>
