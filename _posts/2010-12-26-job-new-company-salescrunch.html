<p>So long time, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>At the tail end of this year, I&rsquo;m starting in with a brand new company, <a href="http://salescrunch.com/" target="_blank">SalesCrunch</a>. It&rsquo;s an exciting new opportunity for me and I&rsquo;m really pumped to be working with a group of talented and experienced individuals who <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> working around Oracle (sorry Hargray).</p>

<p>SalesCrunch&rsquo;s site gives some details and a cool video about what the project it, but the developer lowdown is, we&rsquo;re making a crazy awesome product with a lot of really cool technologies on the back end. I&rsquo;m gonna have lots to blog about in the coming days, when I find the time. Things have been really fast, with a few major deadlines looming (soft-launch was during my first week! No time to start like during the launch cycle!) but its keeping me interested and busy.</p>

<p>Three things make this job a huge step above where I had been:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pairs programming</li>
<li>TDD</li>
<li>Agile development processes.</li>
</ol><p>These are awesome for a number of reasons. Pairs got me up to speed and made me a productive, contributing member to the project on the first day, and TDD is making sure all the code I contribute integrates and works. I&rsquo;ve never done either before and I&rsquo;m really pumped to be working with both. Agile development is pretty sweet too, because it&rsquo;s giving me a small subset of a larger goal and making me feel productive on a day-to-day basis. A lot of previous projects were over-arching &ldquo;We need X done by Y&rdquo;. Now its, &ldquo;Lets get these pieces done today, over the week, to work toward, X.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t say enough for both already.</p>

<p>There will be plenty more to come. Stay tuned on this brand new journey, and definitely check out <a href="http://salescrunch.com/" target="_blank">SalesCrunch</a> and sign up for an invite! Ping me in the comments if you want one and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.</p>
