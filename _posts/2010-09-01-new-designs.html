<p>Working on some new site designs, some for the company I work for on a full time basis, others for my church or personal interests. The portfolio is coming along.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:rbteptBEmfGgzcvtrpHB]]</p>
<p>The first one, called very simply: App Monitor, is a very minimal design for a small, yet very useful site I need at work. I wanted a quick, dirty, yet elegant way to view website status, to check if the site was up, and similarly with the actual server machine. So threw together some quick graphics and a light backend to support it (with some slick JS tricks) and here we go. Its not accessible to public use, since it is an internal app, but I was really happy with the design.</p>

<p>This site has a lot of really interesting ideas working on the back end to do all the site checks and is using some new OSS projects I haven&rsquo;t had time to play with otherwise. Also of note, this is my first project using Rails 3. I already want to switch all my other projects over, although I&rsquo;m not sure how practical that is. We shall see. I&rsquo;ll try to blog about that experience more in the near future.</p>

<p>My other site project is a more professional look, without a lot of flashy elements, but a very clean, information driven design. This one you can access in the public domain, although it is far from complete.</p>

<p>It is still very much a work in progress but I hope to have this site up and functioning as the primary site within the next few weeks, and I am taking over the site for my church. Should be an interesting project for sure.</p>
