<p>Maybe its my lack of usage, maybe its my lack of desire, but I hate writing tests.</p>

<p>Its not because I&rsquo;m not good at it or that its hard to do, but it sucks, pure and simple. Why?</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>It kills motivation to start something</strong>. It seems a massive undertaking, especially at the outset of a project to setup a decent testing structure for projects (somebody please make this easier). If it didn&rsquo;t take knowing how to set up all my frameworks, gems, helpers, factories (or spending hours looking up docs about it), maybe I&rsquo;d be more inclined, but its just daunting.</li>
<li>
<strong>It eats up dev time</strong>. I like programming, playing with code, tinkering with something until it works. Once it works, I can refactor. I could care less about tests. Granted, it ensures going forward my code works, but I know it works (for now). I tend to to CDT (code-driven testing) because of this.</li>
<li>
<strong>Often times it requires me to write more code than I did for the initial feature</strong>. Do I even need to say why I feel like this is not cool? Why would I want to spend more time writing tests than writing fun code? This code will never even see the light of day!</li>
<li>
<strong>Running tests eats time</strong>. It has been called the compiling of interpreted languages. I hate sitting and waiting for things to run. I will admit, CI helps with this. I like submitting tests, even if they break, to CI so it can run and I can write code.</li>
<li>
<strong>Frameworks require learning time</strong>. There are too many libs with too much complication out there. This contributes to #1 and the difficulty in learning, reading, understanding new code and the test framework that was used to test it. <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/" target="_blank">Jasmine</a> for testing Javascript code is an incredibly simple library has been really easy to learn. All testing frameworks should take heed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Testing logic can get complex</strong>. Writing tests to test complex logic can be, well, complex. </li>
<li>
<strong>Tests require you to write testable code</strong>. Sometimes elegant solutions are not easily testable. Depends on how you test (blackbox, whitebox&hellip;).</li>
</ol><p>All that said (and I may have more), I test. With the best. Consistency over convenience I guess&hellip; It does ensure that your code will continue to work as expected. And that is a valuable thing.</p>

<p>It still sucks.</p>
