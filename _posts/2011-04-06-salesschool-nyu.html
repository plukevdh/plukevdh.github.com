<p>The following are my notes from a presentation given by <strong>Jan Schultink,</strong> <em>CEO of Idea Transplant</em>. He came and gave a talk as part of our <a href="http://school.salescrunch.com/how-to-design-stunning-sales-presentations/" target="_blank">SalesSchool</a> program to give relevant content to sales people, in particular for this evening, those who are seeking VC funding.</p>

<p>Also note, we have <a href="http://school.salescrunch.com/how-to-design-stunning-sales-presentations/" target="_blank">another event</a> tonight, again at NYU. More great material focused around much of the same ideas, but more geared towards sales in general, rather than VC pitches.</p>

<p>The video will be up on the site some point in the near future, but for now, here&rsquo;s my take on the presentation.</p>

<h1>How to Design Stunning Sales Presentations</h1>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>No bullet points: means you must construct, audience is faster at reading then you will be at explaining through points.</p>

<p>instead&hellip;</p>

<p>Images are emotional shortcuts to make points.<br />
Packages information much faster. Less need to explain.<br />
Brings emotion to connect to information and boost memory.</p>

<p>Daunting images for backgrounds will burn visual trademark to the information.<br />
Gives big memory recall triggers.</p>

warning: easy to find a person who is duplicated many times. be unique.<br />
develop an eye for picking.</p>

<p>source: flickr CC<br />
warning: quality. be sure to use creative commons, w/ attribution.</p>

<p>Watch proportions.<br />
Ban clip art.<br />
Use advertisements as examples or tutorials for presentations. Good/valuable trends show up here.</p>

<p>Leave much whitespace.<br />
No slide limit, use a time limit instead.</p>

<p>symmetry is bad. use the rule of thirds.</p>

<p>align. poor alignment distracts.</p>

<h2>Sequence - momentup.</h2>

<p>Start left and lower, up and to the right gives a feeling of energy and positive movement.</p>

<p>Easy on the animations. Keeps it simple and professional.</p>

<p>Numbers: simplify and round. No need for hyper-accuracy.</p>

<p>Charts. Don&rsquo;t do small axis labels, don&rsquo;t need 3D graphics. Simplify, show single trends.</p>

<p>Use blank slides in order to bring attention back to presenter.</p>

<h2>Hygiene - general look and feel.</h2>

<p>No comic sans.<br />
No odd colors.<br />
Use professional email addresses with company domain name</p>

<p>Colors: Adobe Kuler.<br />
Be consistent across presentation. Same colors for all slides.</p>

<p>Give content space. Don&rsquo;t do a lot of repeating elements.<br />
Use colors that fit with your corporate identity.</p>

<h2>Stories.</h2>

<p>Do not use an agenda slide. Repetition does not help. Only gives a feeling of being forced.</p>

<p>Presentations are not references. Not business plan driven. Its more driven by trying to find holes.</p>

<p>Using very short &ldquo;stories&rdquo;/information snippets will cause others to want the information, to start to try to find and fill in the details.</p>

<p>Mind memorizes by placing information in spaces (like a picture of a whiteboard)</p>

<p>Think product placement within a story.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t look at powerpoint, use a sheet of paper or listen to yourself to build a presentation.<br />
Will give you a roadmap to build on and find the important points.</p>

<p>Take time to build presentation. 2 weeks for development + 2-3 days to build slides.</p>

<h2>Content - for the VC</h2>

<p>Team intro is helpful at beginning, doesn&rsquo;t have to be on slides.</p>

<p>Presentation is not just the slides. Also many other inputs. Such as:</p>

<p>Gut conviction + Head conviction.<br />
Must pull and convince both.</p>

<p><strong>YOU.</strong> You carry the deck along. The body language speaks.</p>

<p>Convince me that:</p>

<ul>
<li>People will buy</li>
<li>You can sell it</li>
</ul><p>Build trust through honesty.<br />
No: &ldquo;traffic is thru the roof&rdquo; -or- &ldquo;we have no competitors&rdquo;<br />
Feel free to voice uncertainty, with conviction you are still right.</p>

<p>Types of conversations:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 second conf chat

<ul>
<li>Use sentences, not massive amounts of buzzwords.</li>
<li>Made to Stick (book)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t leave people with just a random tune stuck in their heads.</li>
<li>Mission statements have no bearing on those who have no context to work in</li>
<li>Go with specific issues that may just be a single part of the picture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>30 minute pitch

<ul>
<li>TED is 20 minutes. </li>
<li>No need to fill all the time.</li>
<li>Be concise and use remaining time for dialog</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t preach to the converted. Ideas already taking off don&rsquo;t need to be given more value.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t slap all your ideas together into a frankenstein deck.</li>
<li>Pick up signals presentees are sending as responses to your info

<ul>
<li>Address &ldquo;elephant in the room issues&rdquo; early to remove distractions.</li>
<li>Will help focus the investor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus on: What are you doing currently? Even if its a rougher overall picture.</li>
<li>Pitch the problem rather than the features of the solution.</li>
<li>Use visuals to show problems so that the solution becomes apparent by itself.</li>
<li>Maintain momentum. Demo of products will kill this more than anything.

<ul>
<li>Maybe use screenshots instead.</li>
<li>Let them play afterwards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t explain it to a 6 year old, you don&rsquo;t understand it yourself&rdquo; - Einstein</li>
<li>Show very short term plan in great detail. Show long term in more ballpark terms.</li>
<li>Go simpler the greater the lengths of time</li>
<li>Actually justify long term numbers. Plan.</li>
<li>Be consistent. </li>
<li>Framework structures are boring. Recreate as your own using basic/simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Highlight a complimentary team that works together well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>15 minute version

<ul>
<li>Print out, don&rsquo;t staple. Easy to move around within a presentation. Use paper. More flexible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Board Meeting

<ul>
<li>will not depend entirely on deck</li>
<li>move off to excel or detailed data transmission tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>For potential &ldquo;pre deck screenings&rdquo; either give information as part of the slide, write out the message in a side column, or create two decks.</p>

<h2>Webinars</h2>

<p>Get technology set up correctly<br />
Page reference for fast switching (easy to go back or move around within deck)<br />
Avoid 5 second charts. Charts need to be focus points.<br />
Make it about fewer slide transitions.<br />
Build up with pointers.<br />
Explain why you are silent (drinking water, etc).</p>

Gain insight into successful presentations. Some VCs give pointers to what they liked.</p>

<h2>One more thing.</h2>

<p><strong>Practice!!!</strong>
Rumor has it, Steve Jobs takes 3 working days to practice.<br />
Must be on top of/know totality of content in order to be spontaneous.</p>

<p>Always make point early. Don&rsquo;t get cut off.</p>

<p>What slide stays on the longest? <strong>The last one.</strong> Usually says &ldquo;Q&amp;A&rdquo;&hellip;<br />
Should be something that you discussed to help burn into minds as they sit doing something else.</p>
