<p>I have recently discovered an interesting tendency in my thinking patterns about code. Before the past few months, I would have said that I am not a terribly possessive person. I like OSS and collaborating on projects. But for the first time in my professional career, I am working on a project on which I am collaborating with other developers. As I have done so, I have found a strange feeling of <em>pain</em>, or <em>discomfort</em> with other developers changing my code. I worked so hard to get this to work, to make that happen, to optimize that runtime. And then someone goes and changes it.</p>

<h2>This is bad, mmk?</h2>

<p>Being possessing with code leaves no room for other people to work. It also builds feelings of animosity within a team. It can be easy to feel judged, as if your code isn&rsquo;t good enough and needed to be redone. Most of the time, rewriting code is good. First runs are often just with the goal of &ldquo;make it work&rdquo; or &ldquo;get tests to pass&rdquo;. Second (or third) pass is for refactors and optimizations. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m still in the mid-level developer category. I have lots to learn and I&rsquo;m fortunate to be on a team with a senior-level developer (if these classifications actually mean anything) who has more experience and a mind with a good grasp of writing code for flexibility (<strong>webscale</strong>, son). I&rsquo;m learning a lot from how he rewrites my code or by pairing with him over changes assigned to me.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t possess code. Get other people to look it over. Let it change easily. Be open to criticism or change rejections. It only makes the code better and give you more insight into how to write better code.</p>

<p>Yay community.</p>
