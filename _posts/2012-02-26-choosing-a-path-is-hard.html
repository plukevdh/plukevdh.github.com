<p>Today I read a number of articles in succession, as I often do when reading on the internet. Today's internet articles are so scattered with hyperlinks and youtube videos, I feel like someone loaded up a shotgun with other content and blasted it into what I was trying to read.</p>
<p>In any case, these three articles are posted here. Try to read them first, even if the content isn't really along your lines of work or interest. In order of my reading (and linkage):</p>
<h1><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://raganwald.posterous.com/giles-bowkett-summons-monsters">Giles Bowkett summons monsters</a></span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">which references:</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.in/2012/02/rails-went-off-rails-why-im-rebuilding.html" target="_blank">Rails Went Off The Rails</a></strong></p>
<p>which quotes a bit from:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523" target="_blank">A Conversation with Alan Kay</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Okay, so that was a lot of reading. Each one sparks something a little different in me. The first article focuses the second, in that it talks about what Giles is getting at in code and programming culture. His assesment is fair in that:</span></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Once you view the post as being about software development culture instead of about software development tools, everything clicks together. This is not a post about Rails and Node, it&rsquo;s a post about&nbsp;people and culture. It&rsquo;s not about how Node and CoffeeScript change&nbsp;everything, it&rsquo;s about how they change&nbsp;nothing, because we haven&rsquo;t changed. We&rsquo;re still on a path to re-invent all the ceremony and design patterns and cruft of the last go-around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is depressing to me, partly because it's so unbeliveably true. I am just as guily of what Giles talks about in his article, that the old decry's the new as bratty and immature while the new mocks the old as slow and inefficient. To quote Giles:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sulky, bratty teenage Rails had three big things it made fun of the Java old folks for: design patterns, the JVM's long startup time, and&nbsp;<a href="http://bryanpendleton.blogspot.com/2010/02/ceremony-vs-essence.html">overly ceremonial code</a>&nbsp;which had nothing to do with the day-to-day experience of writing web apps. Today Rails has a startup time which is so long, the Rails community actually created&nbsp;<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/285-spork">Spork, a gem which keeps your Rails environment alive between test runs</a>, because otherwise it's hard to use TDD with Rails. Rails tests can take so long to run that by the time a test run completes, you're liable to forget what you were doing, and, in fact, your name. The Rails community mocked design patterns relentlessly when it was Node's age, but look at how ActiveRecord::Base hijacks&nbsp;<code>inherited</code>&nbsp;and you'll realize that this [...] is an&nbsp;<code>ActiveRecordClassFactory</code>&nbsp;in denial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these views make me sad, for a few reasons. One is that it shows how true the first quote I posted. We are reinventing things because programming is becoming a pop-culture career that likes to cleave to the new, the hip, the easy. Secondly, because of this, we're redoing a LOT of things that are already done, designed, patterned really well. (Even worse, we're doing it in JAVASCRIPT!?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then you read an article with men like Alan Kay and Stuart Feldman who embody what it meant to be a computer scientist, not just a developer. In a sense, they understood keenly the "scientist" in the Computer Science field. Just look at what they did: They spent the majority of their careers in research departments, not developing software as a product, but inventing languages, creating methodologies, documenting patterns.</p>
<p>And somewhere in a world gone crazy with the latest tech, the hottest new language on the block, which should lead to the sexiest job in the world, we've lost the drive to create, rather than be a creature governed by our tastes. As the oft-quoted and still missing _why put it:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow &amp; exclude people. so create.<br style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Trebuchet, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: left;" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This "being defined by tastes" attitude is abundantly clear in the Rails and Node communities, as evidenced even in the flamewars had around such blog posts. "We do things our way because it's better because of X, Y and Z and you suck at all those things" rather than spending that energy in creating new. I've jumped on that bandwagon on several occasions. And I am not proud of that. And sadly, as I read articles like these, I realize that in most of my day-to-day development, I am not an engineer or a scientist. I am a subscriber to pop-culture, merely a user of what exists, defining my work by what I use. Alan Kay puts it eloquently:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>If you look at software today, through the lens of the history of engineering, it&rsquo;s certainly engineering of a sort&mdash;but it&rsquo;s the kind of engineering that people without the concept of the arch did. Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This upsets me, because it means I am not advancing the science of computers, but rather abetting the increase of knowledge and craft. I am a specialist, not a scientist. And as we all know from DJ&nbsp;Horace "the Pacifist" Walsh from K-JAH radio in GTA3, "You want&nbsp;knowledge, get&nbsp;yourself&nbsp;the&nbsp;Scientist", mon.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me in this pop-culture as it moves from popularity towards acceptance is the reverence of old languages and design patterns. Ruby, as it has matured (we're going on 16 years since initial release), has started to look back. Smalltalk, oddly, is a language rubyists hold up as an icon of the programming language world. Which begs the question first, why are you using Ruby then, and second, why now? Smalltalk has existed since the '70s and you're only now discovering it had good ideas? At the same time, patterns are again all the rage, which is what the Ruby/Rails community initially flocked to Ruby to escape from in Java. And the cycle begins again -- after it's barely started in Ruby -- with Node. From <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org'</a>s homepage:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Node.js is a platform built on&nbsp;Chrome's JavaScript runtime&nbsp;for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been dozens of blog posts, articles and examples written about this very statement and how Node misses the point of what it is trying to deliver. But more important to me is the step <em>back </em>this framework seems to take in recreating concepts that have existed for years. You know what else accomplishes the same ideas? Threads. But oh wait, threads are hard.&nbsp;So here we are again, reinventing the wheel in another color to excite another generation of "ninjas and rockstars" when we could have been creating new ways of computing. It seems such a waste.</p>
<p>All this is to say, instead of getting depressed, I want to find a way to step off the circle and move forward, build something new, or at least learn from what exists and build from that. Aperture&nbsp;Science founder Cave Johnson said: "They say great science is built on the shoulders of giants - not here. At Aperture we do all our science from scratch; no hand holding." Let's not do that. Let's learn and move forward. Create, and build bridges. For science.</p>
