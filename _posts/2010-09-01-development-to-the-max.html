<p>Well, not only do I play the full-time 9-5er, but I launch new projects in the off time. I have so many side projects its not even that funny anymore. I need to settle down and work on one. The problem is that some of them involve a lot more work and time learning than I have time to do. Sometimes I just want a project that I can get into and go with rather than having to learn as I go. Ruby/Rails is my primary mode of development, so I&rsquo;ve been trying for some time to think up a good project.</p>

<p>Tonight it finally happened. So now will you please welcome Hastie! The new way to schedule things. Actually its not new, but its got a lot of potential. I&rsquo;m always a big fan of single source applications that tie a bunch of resources into a single go-to location. Now I get to try to write one. Lots of ideas in the works for this, most of which will take sometime, or well I suppose they might not since there is already so much functionality out there for some of the features I want to add in. Like Facebook and Twitter for example already have good and diverse APIs that people have written Ruby wrappers for. So I dunno how long it might take to add all the stuff I have planned for it, but its a project. A good one. Check it out, browse around, tell me what you think and if you recognize the design schema from any other projects!</p>
