<p>As some may have noticed from the logo in the bottom of this screen, I use <a href="http://typekit.com/" target="_blank">Typekit</a> for some font design for my web projects. They are a very cool service adding a lot of &ldquo;cool-factor&rdquo; to any web project. Yet another reason to love being a web developer.</p>

<p>And as-per <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2010/05/11/simplified-accounts/" target="_blank">this</a> latest blog post, they just opened up their Portfolio account to use unlimited fonts for unlimited sites. Pretty cool. I had often wondered if I would be able to use them beyond a few sites as I get into more and more freelance work. Very good to know they&rsquo;ve been concerned with this too. Thanks Typekit! Keep up the amazing work.</p>
