<p>Well 6 weeks worth of work on this baby and we now have a fully self-contained distributable project with slick Rails integration.</p>
<p>The initial release of Kthxbye focused on the machine behind the gem: the queuing processing of jobs. This release is more of a front-end and Rails&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;release. This gem extracts out a lot of the built-in functionality that I had built around the gem into the primary application this gem was built to enhance. Mostly it involves the work I&rsquo;ve been doing with Node.js and Socket.IO. It&rsquo;s really simple code and if you want a look at the Node notification engine, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://github.com/plukevdh/kthxbye-node" target="_blank">here</a>. There&rsquo;s a lot of new documentation added to the README file which ought to help you figure out how it works and what all needs to be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also my first experiment in Rails 3 &gt; Railtie gemification. Railtie is really powerful engine an unfortunate few undocumented secrets (like that all generators apparently need to be named &ldquo;&lt;name&gt;_generator.rb&rdquo; in order to be picked up by Rails automatically). In any case, this gem is now super easy to integrate into your project that needs delayed job computation and callback notifications.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next? Well, probably more features, a few enhancements, better reporting, and more slick ways to interact with Kthxbye.</p>
<p>Check it out now with &ldquo;gem install kthxbye&rdquo;. Enjoy all!</p>
