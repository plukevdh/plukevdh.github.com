<p>So what have I learned by venturing out in the unexplored labyrinth of Javascript application development?</p>

<h1>Its not as hard as you think</h1>

<p>As developers, whether formally trained via the architects of higher education or simply learned through experience and mentorship, we are natural-born learners. We were taught to figure things out by experimentation and exploration of available knowledge. What&rsquo;s even better is most developer communities are also eager to spread knowledge. Maybe its the fact that we like learning from others that we also desire to be learned from. But the sheer amount of information available is simply staggering. I&rsquo;ll put some of my most referenced articles as part of the recent foray into JS.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/" target="_blank">JavaScript Garden</a> - really helpful listing of common gotchas and quirks with the language.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page" target="_blank">jQuery docs</a> - because we use jQuery here.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a> - makes writing our code much faster and leaves us a smaller code footprint in terms of LOC.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://darcyclarke.me/development/javascript-applications-101/" target="_blank">JS Apps 101</a> - great insights in to how it should be done.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/how-custom-events-will-save-us-all" target="_blank">Custom Events will save us all</a> - good evented programming cases.</li>
</ul><p>There have been many more on this list that have come across my browser as I search for stuff, but these have been influential and oft returned to as this project has progressed.</p>
