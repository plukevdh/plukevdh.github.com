<p>I already entered &ldquo;:wq&rdquo; in way too many other editors. This certainly isn&rsquo;t going to help.</p>

<p>Starting up with vim as my primary editor. Going to take some time to get used to, but I really like it so far. I always wanted to use keyboard only navigation&hellip;</p>

<p>Some helps I&rsquo;ve found along the way are:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a></p>
<p>Peepcode screencasts (<a href="http://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-i" target="_blank">I</a> and <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-ii" target="_blank">II</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://seechrisblog.com/2010/05/18/getting-ack-to-work-in-vim-on-ubuntu/" target="_blank">Ubuntu fix </a>for <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2572" target="_blank">Ack</a></p>
<p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/" target="_blank">Yehuda Katz&rsquo;s thoughts.</a></p>
<p>This will probably be a fluid list, so stay tuned!</p>
