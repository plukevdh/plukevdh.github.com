<p>Continuing the rant&hellip;</p>

<p>So I already knew IE7 didn&rsquo;t respect the inline-block property. That sucks. Its really hard to do some types of layout without that property. So what to do?</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this hack works (from flipc.blogspot.com). Just add:</p>

<p><code> zoom: 1; *display: inline; _height: 30px; </code></p>

<p>to the end of your styling for the element you need inline-block to work for. It doesn&rsquo;t screw with Firefox or even IE8 (which handles inline-block just fine&hellip;).</p>

<p>So moral of the story is still don&rsquo;t use IE. Period. Solution one is Mozilla&rsquo;s Firefox. Solution 2 is at least ie6update.com</p>
