<p>Reflecting on the last post, one other thing came to mind regarding rock-stardom. In trying to interact with many of the &ldquo;head&rsquo;s of state&rdquo; at RubyConf (<a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Paterson</a>, <a href="http://obiefernandez.com/" target="_blank">Obie Fernandez</a>, etc.), while I was greeted cordially, it often goes no further than that. Part of the dangers of stardom in any circle is that <strong>you</strong> start to believe you&rsquo;re a big deal. You become too big to be bothered by the common coder. You make the money, you have the groupies. Now you are the elite, and only those who share that elite may get a word in edgewise. Part of what I want to see is those that have the most to contribute to code, also have the most to give to others. The most beneficial conversations I had were with people who had nothing to gain from a conversation other than friendship. Developers who loved doing what they do and want to share that passion for a platform or a community with others. Those who are working all hours to enable others to go the extra mile and be great. Not for their own glory, but for the sake of community. Those are the people I love to meet and interact with and work along side.</p>

<p>Be those people. You do us all proud.</p>
