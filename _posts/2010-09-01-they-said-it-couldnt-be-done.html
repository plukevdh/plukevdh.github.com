<p>Actually nobody said that. Or maybe I did. In any case&hellip;</p>

<p>After much delay and a bit of big talk about trying to launch this deal for real, I at least have the blog together. I&rsquo;m still very much in the process of putting together the site design on the whole, but I&rsquo;m liking where it is. Authentication bits are now working although being logged in doesn&rsquo;t really do anything for you&hellip; so yeah. Not much point to that yet. Hang in there though, I promise it will be worth it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also looking to soon add ways for you to contact me here at HungerAndThirstDesign.com, as currently, our only method of contact is really Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/HaTDesignHaTDesign" target="_blank">HaTD</a>). So please drop us a line and we&rsquo;ll get back to you that way, push updates, or generally tell you when you&rsquo;ll be able to contact us for reals.</p>

<p>Lastly, just want to say I&rsquo;m very excited about the upcoming release of Rails 3, and hoping that the Rails team can make good on the hints to push it out late February. Will definitely be looking to make this and future sites work better, faster and more efficient on the new framework. Pumped!!</p>
