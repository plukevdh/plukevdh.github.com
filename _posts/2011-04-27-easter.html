<p>This is not my traditional venue for sharing these kinds of thoughts or links, but this is something near and dear to my heart that anyone who knows me ought to hear.</p>

<p>So many of the people I follow or know within technical or developer circles distain, abhor, make fun or light of what and Who Easter is about. This is the day that Jesus Christ rose from the grave, demonstrating that all he said was true.</p>

<p>John 20:30-31 says: &ldquo;The disciples saw Jesus do many other miraculous signs in addition to the ones recorded in this book. But these are written so that you may continue to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, <em>the Son of God</em>, and <strong>that by believing in him you will have life</strong> by the power of his name.</p>

<p>You can disagree with me as you like, but I believe the message of this video with all my heart. Watch with an open mind and heart. I pray it changes your life.</p>
