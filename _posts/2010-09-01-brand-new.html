<p>First job as a freelance web designed is now out in the wild.</p>

<p><a href="http://lowcountrycc.org" target="_blank">LowCountry Community Church</a></p>

<p>[[posterous-content:uucEeeyutwfyFFshgEza]]</p>

<p>Still wrestling between domain name providers to transfer the old domain over (from NetworkSolutions to GoDaddy). Just as a technical FYI, NetworkSolutions currently does not allow setting of a single A Record name (say www) to multiple ip addresses (as is needed with Heroku via <a href="http://docs.heroku.com/custom-domains" target="_blank">this</a> article.</p>

<p>Still work to be done in allowing the end admins to be able to customize the copy without my intervention, but that&rsquo;ll come. This weekend was the deadline to make the switch over from their old static page site to mine. Not too bad&hellip;.</p>
