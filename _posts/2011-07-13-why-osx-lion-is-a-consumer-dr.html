<p>I started using the developer release of Lion about two weeks ago. While I enjoy a few of the new features, I have not found it to be as impressive as Snow Leopard was in it&rsquo;s offerings. This may seem odd because Snow Leopard was branded as a &ldquo;maintenance upgrade&rdquo; focused on stability and performance improvements. Well, that update that we were told was &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; was a massive architecture change. OS X went from simply supporting 64-bit to actually running the entire OS as 64-bit. It added better multi-processor/core support and GPU usage improvements. Those changed the way any and all of my software runs.</p>

<p>Not being a Mac Dev, some of the Lion additions don&rsquo;t mean much for me and the software I write and run or the software that I use on a daily basis. Moreover some of the changes (fullscreen esp.) don&rsquo;t help me in the least when I&rsquo;m running multiple monitors. The idea sounds nice, but in reality, when am I ever using one window at a time? Even as I&rsquo;m writing this I&rsquo;m checking Twitter and Propane (Campfire) for other info.</p>

<p>Some of the changes are useful (though have yet to be integrated into my workflow) like Mission Control. I struggle to regularly and effectively use multiple desktops, especially when I&rsquo;m again using multiple monitors. It&rsquo;s just not as time saving for me. The fact that Apple finally seems to have gotten Cmd-Tab to work right over multiple spaces will probably change my mind on this fact.</p>

<p>All this goes to say that most of these changes are UI updates. They are very driven towards making the UI look closer to the iOS UI. Not a full conversion, but Apple repeatedly states that it is the &ldquo;full circle&rdquo;, bringing back to the Mac what it did to the mobile UI space. Which is not a bad idea. However, it does make it more about what the user sees than how it performs, and that makes it very consumer-driven. Lion makes Apple&rsquo;s OS lines (mobile and desktop) more unified, easier to transition between and, most importantly, more attractive. Users, technical and non-technical alike will find these changes revolutionary and useful. While these are all things I appreciate and will use often, as a non-platform specific developer, not as useful to me in every-day application and/or development.</p>

<p>Snow Leopard will probably stand alone (or at least very lonely) as a major update that did not involve a massive UI overhaul and yet revolutionized the platform. Apple still has a massive leg up on most other platforms I have used (Windows, and (oh snap) Linux) simply because they are dedicated to improving UI and the OS performance at the same time. I have not used a product so well polished in both areas.</p>
