<p><strong>Note</strong>, I started this a couple months back and am just now getting the time to finish. Dates/times may be off now.</p>

<p>Finally a bit of a break with some time to write. Busy and in the middle of switching jobs while training up new people for my old job. These thoughts come more out of RubyConf as I flew back home a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>There is an unusual trend in the developer culture that has not gone unnoticed by many people. It&rsquo;s the idea of &ldquo;rock star coders&rdquo;. You know what I mean. Those people who we all hold in high regard because of the body of work or the high-visibility of the projects they have worked on. Its an unusual phenomenon which, as far as I have seen, only two developer circles suffer from: iOS developers and Ruby developers. Think about it. How many &ldquo;rock star&rdquo; PHP developers can you name? How many people would you put in the Java hall of fame? Okay, how about Ruby?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s just a few off the top:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/defunkt" target="_blank">Chris Wanstrath</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mperham" target="_blank">Mike Perham</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rtomayko" target="_blank">Ryan Tomayko</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/qrush" target="_blank">Nick Quaranto</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/" target="_blank">DHH</a></li>
</ol><p>Or Mac/iOS?</p>

<li><a href="http://mattgemmell.com/" target="_blank">Matt Gemmell</a></li>
</ol><p>And I&rsquo;m sure we could all name many more in both categories. Now some would ask, &ldquo;Why is this a bad thing? It&rsquo;s awesome our languages/industries/social circles have heros! We&rsquo;re usually the uncool, nerdy class. Now we can be awesome!&rdquo; While I certainly approve of the positive press developers are starting to get, the whole idea of coder rock-stars strikes me as a step back. I certainly like that we can have high-visibility people who give us inspiration and lots of quality code, but when we switch to idolization of anyone (not just developers), we are doomed to sit in their shadow and so stunt our own creativity. I have realized that the time I have spent admiring individuals and their code has meant so much less time spent developing my own coding style and technique. I&rsquo;ve created much less because I&rsquo;ve sat in awe of the &ldquo;Big Names&rdquo; in the Ruby/Rails community. I started thinking about working hard, learning the Rails core in order to become a core contributor so that I could be seen as a &ldquo;Big Name&rdquo; in my own right in the community. How awesome would that be?!</p>

<p>As I bounced from talk to talk at RubyConf, I realized that, while I was seeing a lot of cool stuff, I began to get in the mindset that I&rsquo;ll never make anything as cool as these guys have and will. And when you end up there, motivation to write new and innovative goes out the window.</p>

<p>Which sucks. For you <em>and</em> for the community you are apart of.</p>

<p>What would be far better for us is to use what is being done to fuel our own ideas and creativity, not store up awe and reverence for earthly beings, who are making strides by looking ahead and not around.</p>

<p>=== Waxing philosophical</p>

<p>Society in general is very competition-driven. We want to 1-up the Jones&rsquo;. We want to beat that 14yo. at Call of Duty: Black Ops. We want to write code that is cutting-edge and used by millions. It&rsquo;s a natural attitude.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also wrong.</p>

<p>We tend to idolize those who stand out as above and beyond those in their own class. Sports is a huge example of this. That&rsquo;s really the point of sports. But then it starts to move into other areas of life. Like work. And usually this creates a less-than-healthy environment/mindset for working.</p>

<p>Competition is an odd fuel for productivity. We often think competition in the workplace should help build products or more fascinating code. Yet when we compete, someone else inevitably ends up on the bottom. And that&rsquo;s bad for morale.</p>

<p>And bad morale is bad for everyone.</p>

<p>So a word to the community I am a part of and those I know by extension: Put away the idolization of developers (or anything else). Do your job. Create, innovate, do something new. Do something old if it means learning something new. Reinventing the wheel teaches you how to make wheels. Then you can take that knowledge and do something with wheels that no one has done before a lot better than someone who&rsquo;s never made a wheel.</p>

<p>Most of all, work for the community and the benefit of others, not for rock-stardom. In the end, it benefits us all more than making monumental changes to high-profile projects. And I&rsquo;m not just talking about code.</p>

<p>Do it in your community, whether that&rsquo;s a workplace, a church, a school or your neighborhood. So much good could be done by working for the benefit of others rather than the grandifying of self.</p>
