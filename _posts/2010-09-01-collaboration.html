<p>I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce a new collaboration project between <a href="http://hungerandthirstdesign.com/" target="_blank">HungerAndthirst Design </a>and <a href="http://www.tgstudios.com/" target="_blank">TGStudios</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://peerdrum.com" target="_blank">Peerdrum</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a really slick app that works for companies looking to move more of their employees remote and for employees tired of working from a normal office.</p>

<p>Trust is usually a big issue for employers when evaluating whether or not to allow employees to work remotely. People work remote all the time, but for many smaller businesses and companies that rely on untested, untrusted contractors, it&rsquo;s hard to ensure that people aren&rsquo;t charging you for hours they really didn&rsquo;t work or that employees aren&rsquo;t getting paid for hours spent doing non-work related activities.</p>

<p>The idea behind Peerdrum is that employers should be able to rest easy that their employees are working while on the clock, and employees won&rsquo;t have to worry about tracking time manually. The app will monitor the employees activities and send screenshots and hours logged back to the project supervisors. Want to jump off the clock, browse Facebook for a while? No problem, just pause the screenshot app on your desktop, spend some you-time, then start it back up again when you&rsquo;re ready to start working again. Nothing gets logged when you&rsquo;re off the clock, so all your private data is still untouched and your supervisors won&rsquo;t have to worry about you playing around on their dime!</p>

<p>The initial info can be found at the evangelism site for the project, <a href="http://peerdrum.com/" target="_blank">Peerdrum.com</a>. The project it set to launch sometime in August and I&rsquo;m really excited to show this baby off. It&rsquo;s some stuff I&rsquo;ve never done before and its a pretty slick idea on the whole. Stay tuned&hellip;</p>
