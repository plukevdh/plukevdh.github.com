<p>So I mentioned last week that I was making the switch to VIM. Well here we are, a week later, and where are am I so far? Much better than expected. I installed fresh VIM on my linux dev machine and, since I haven&rsquo;t found a dependable editor on linux that wasn&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/" target="_blank">slow</a> as <a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails" target="_blank">hell</a> or <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html" target="_blank">almost</a>&nbsp;totally <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/" target="_blank">useless</a> for my customary workflow, it was fairly easy not to be tempted to revert to my old editor, since I didn&rsquo;t really have one on Linux. Mac still pulls me in the way of <a href="http://macromates.com/" target="_blank">TextMate</a> or <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/" target="_blank">Coda</a> (which is still one of my favorites of all time), but even there, for quick edits, and even hardcore refactoring, its getting really hard to be without VIM&rsquo;s super-extensive and extendable keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a learning curve and I&rsquo;m still very much learning and trying to remember what does what and what will make this function faster, how I can bounce about, replace, update code better. It takes a lot of memory power, but starting out slow, you kinda just learn as you go along. :h gives me plenty of info about things I&rsquo;ve seen people do or want to learn how to do. The built in help is probably one of the best things ever. Every editor should come with this much help before it can be released. I&rsquo;m srsly you guys&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m generally a fan of one input device if I can help it, and this is definitely where VIM shines for me. Even in MS Word, I start typing :w to save instead of Ctrl-S&hellip; But now that I&rsquo;m getting the swing of the navigation tools within VIM, I&rsquo;m getting pretty versatile in moving around the code really quickly. A few plugins I would recommend using early on (regardless of what language you&rsquo;re working with) to aid in the migration are:</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen" target="_blank">Pathogen</a> &ndash; Simple plugin installation just by dropping vim plugins into a single folder.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree" target="_blank">NERDTree</a> &ndash; A TextMate-like drawer/file browser for VIM. Splits browsing files into a separate buffer for quick perusal of projects and the like.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42" target="_blank">BufExplorer</a> &ndash; Lets you jump around your buffers very quickly. Not necessary, but I use this one to bounce around files a lot faster. Almost like tabs for your editor (without using VIM&rsquo;s built-in tabs).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90" target="_blank">VCSCommand</a> if you use SVN or a wide variety of other SVC systems. Git is included in this pkg, but I like to use <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-git" target="_blank">vim-git </a>and <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive" target="_blank">vim-fugitive </a>instead).</p>
<p><a href="http://betterthangrep.com/" target="_blank">Ack</a> &ndash; Better than grep. All you need to know.</p>
<p>There are half a dozen others I use for Rails/Ruby development, but these are the mainstays. I am in VIM to stay for now. At least until TextMate2 comes out&hellip;</p>
