<h2>First up: Apple and the 4g phone &ldquo;leak&rdquo;</h2>
<p>
I think it was deliberate, although part of me is pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t. Not because Apple needs the press, but partly because it comes in a fairly vicious time for Apple and developers after the 3.3.1 clause in the SDK EULA. Maybe something to keep the general public happy and interested. So for what it&rsquo;s worth, Apple, keep your stuff under control. Those kinda shenanigans melt servers with blog posts, feeds, and basically clog the interwebs. Just.Don&rsquo;t.Do.It.
</p>
<p>
Better yet, what if this is another Gizmodo hoax? Faux-iPhone from China maybe? Some kickass design work from the graphics design department?
</p>
<h2>Next: Gizmodo</h2>
<p>
Companies or services (or whatever you call a group like the one behind Gizmodo) run on a business model that revolves solely around numbers. They&rsquo;re really in the business of creating content around their ads. Ads is really the major way a blogging or news service makes its revenue, especially on the web with a non-subscriber based model. So it makes sense they would go after the biggest news story possible. I can&rsquo;t blame them. Sure they probably could have done it better, sure they probably screwed Powell over.
</p>
<p>
The way I see it though, any company driven by &ldquo;followers&rdquo; rather than the quality of the services they can provide is already losing. What&rsquo;s the point? Tabloidism is a dumb way to make a living. I&rsquo;m not even sure I&rsquo;d call what Gizmodo does a &ldquo;service&rdquo;. Its putting out content. Really low quality (and probably unedited) content&hellip; What&rsquo;s more is when they find a story like this they talk it to death. Somebody kill it already.
</p><p>
The point is, if we lose site of service quality for numbers, we end up like McDonalds: Everywhere serving zillions but its not a place you&rsquo;re proud to work. Its not something you&rsquo;re proud to say you participated in.
</p><p>
I do have to say, the hardliner Apple geeks love ripping on Gizzie and its <a href="https://twitter.com/chockenberry/statuses/12524828533" target="_blank">really funny</a> to see. Settle down yo.
