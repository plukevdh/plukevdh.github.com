<p>No, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:xnmGwuhEHtfruyjyDcxa]]</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna do a bit of backtracking on what I told you before. After a good couple of days of futzing about with fibers, EventMachine and Processes and have made some interesting discoveries about how to go about things when working out concurrency.</p>
<p>Fibers are awesome, but they&rsquo;re a bit tricky when it comes to using at a higher level around other libraries. Why? Because there is no good way to preempt fibers when it hits a blocking process&hellip; such as a long DB call, which is the whole point. In order to get that level of preemption, I&rsquo;d have to make all the supporting libraries fiber aware as well. That&rsquo;s a lot of work for this project. It would involve, at least in this instance, modifying <a href="http://github.com/rsim" target="_blank">Raimonds Simanovskis</a> <a href="http://github.com/rsim/ruby-plsql" target="_blank">PLSQL adapter</a> and probably the <a href="http://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced" target="_blank">oracle_enhanced</a> gem as well and that&rsquo;s way beyond the scope of this project. Probably worth doing, just not what I&rsquo;m working on at the moment.</p>
<p>So that leaves EM and Processes. I worked with EM for a bit and discovered its a bit tricky to use within an infinite loop. It works, just not as well as I&rsquo;d like and without the level of concurrency or controllability I would like. Deferrables are nice, but it&rsquo;s hard to spawn off multiple defers for each of the blocking processes that might be run in parallel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More importantly, I&rsquo;ve decided that running multicore-able is going to be better that multi-threadable (which would only allow us to run on a single core in Ruby due to the GIL). The only way to do that in Ruby is, yep, you guessed it: Processes. And reading <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/unicorn-is-unix" target="_blank">this article on Unicorn</a>&nbsp;makes me believe using processes rather than threads/fibers or evented programming is a really respectable option. Perhaps the only option for web/network programming. Threads just don&rsquo;t perform nicely in Ruby. Fibers don&rsquo;t offer enough options or true concurrency (rather cooperative scheduling). Evented Programming doesn&rsquo;t work as well for our architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So on to processes. This architectural decision has held up development of Kthxbye now for a couple of days, so now onward to greatness. Stay tuned.</p>
