<p>I&rsquo;ve finally decided to break down and not maintain my own blogging engine. Oddly enough, almost all Rails tutorials are all about &ldquo;how to create a blog in under 15 minutes&rdquo; but the maintaining one is actually not worth it when there are so many worthy blogging webapps out there. This is a cool one. Its like the awesome, non-bloated Wordpress cousin.</p>

<p>&hellip;INITIATE IMPORT&hellip;</p>

<p>hungerandthirstdesign.com/blogs will now become blog.hungerandthirstdesign.com</p>

<p>Thanks for watching!</p>
